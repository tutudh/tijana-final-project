# Research brief: online labeling with joint error and cost guarantees

Venue target: AISTATS 2026. This brief frames the standing goal for every
stage. The research constitution and the assumption, comparator, and
literature policies included in context are binding.

## Problem setting

Items arrive online at rounds `t = 1, ..., T`. For each item the learner
chooses among one or more cheap labeling sources (for example model
predictions with confidence scores; losses normalized to `[0, 1]`; costs
possibly heterogeneous and nonzero) and a costly expert whose label is
authoritative (reference instantiation: unit cost, zero loss). The learner may
audit an AI-labeled item: pay the expert cost, observe the true label, and
release the corrected label. Feedback is partial — expert labels are observed
only on deferred or audited items. Decisions and audit probabilities must be
predictable with respect to the natural filtration, and released-label loss,
counterfactual source loss, and estimated feedback must be kept distinct. The
precise instantiation (number of sources, cost structure, score model) is the
designer's choice and must be stated per the constitution.

## Target

An online labeling algorithm and a theorem establishing, simultaneously and
under admissible problem-level assumptions:

1. **Error guarantee**: released-label error at most `epsilon * T + o(T)`
   (high probability preferred; state the exact semantics), and
2. **Cost guarantee**: total cost — every paid model call, expert deferral,
   audit, and correction — at most the cost of an explicit admissible
   comparator plus `o(T)`.

An impossibility result (for example an audit-cost lower bound at a weaker
assumption rung) paired with a positive result at the next admissible rung is
an acceptable, potentially stronger, contribution shape.

## Assumption discipline (binding)

Admissible assumptions are about the problem itself: i.i.d. or otherwise
stochastic non-adversarial arrivals, stationarity or an explicit mixing
condition, bounded losses and costs, distributional regularity of confidence
scores stated on the data distribution and checkable in principle from data, a
known safe expert. Inadmissible: optimizer-local or proof-artifact conditions
— anything defined only around an unknown optimal policy, price, or threshold
(strict complementarity, uniqueness of an optimal dual price, local
nondegeneracy or curvature at the optimum, a margin defined only at the
unknown optimizer), and any condition introduced solely to close a proof that
lacks an operational interpretation and diagnostic. A borderline condition
must be classified honestly and flagged for human review, never assumed
silently.

## What already exists (do not re-derive as a contribution)

- Candes, Ilyas, and Zrnic, "Probably Approximately Correct Labels": offline
  single-model PAC labeling, multi-model PAC routing, learned uncertainty
  recalibration, and cost-sensitive routing.
- This project's current online theorem: audited price updates control
  finite-horizon released-label error at `epsilon + B_T` with
  `B_T = O(T^{-1/2})` under predictable audits with a probability floor. It
  has NO cost guarantee. The missing joint error-plus-cost theorem (or the
  impossibility/positive pair) is precisely the contribution target.
- The offline LP / dual-price view is an explanatory reformulation, not a
  novelty claim.

## Literature lanes

Online risk control; intermittent or partial-feedback conformal methods;
online stochastic linear programming; revenue management; constrained
contextual bandits; online learning with long-term constraints;
label-efficient prediction; online selective classification; online learning
to defer. Follow the literature policy's exact-source discipline; absence of
found prior work is never evidence of novelty.

## Honesty

Every model output is a theorem or proof candidate. A reviewer `pass` is a
workflow status, not an established result. Promotion into the paper or the
research-state documents requires human review.
